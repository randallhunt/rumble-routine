Rumble Routine
================

Chrome browser extension to schedule your favorite Rumble streams to play automatically.

## What is it?

Do you have a set of favorite Rumble streams that you like to tune in for every day? Would you love it if you could just leave a browser window open, and have the streams tune in automatically, rather than fumbling around to find your open tab among your 7 windows full of dozens of tabs just to refresh for the next available feed?

With Rumble Routine, you just go to the channel you want to add, and add it to the schedule. Then, every time it is scheduled to start, your browser automatically opens a tab and starts the stream for you.

## Requirements

This is a Chrome extension, and it requires Chrome version 92 or higher.  That's it.

## Installation

Install directly from the [Chrome Extensions](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/rumble-routine/djaaljlanegcfhbnmgcneaijiafgcccc) web site. Or if you prefer, you can download the source from this repo and install by hand.
